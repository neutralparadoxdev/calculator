A Simple Calculator Without Any Branding

### Description

Calculator is a simple calculator modeled after a physical calculator. 

Press the buttons on screen to use it. Such as pressing '1', '+', '1', and 'equals' will add 1 + 1 and display '2' Instead of pressing equals, press '+' again and it will both display '2' and 
is prepared to recieve another value to add. This calculator performs operations as added. Therefore, 
it does **NOT FOLLOW THE RULES OF OPERATIONS**.

It was created using React, Typescript, and Create React App. Those projects are separate and do not
endorse or promote this project.

This caculator uses floating point and string conversions. Certain values converting to and from 
floating point (number type) may not be correct. However, entered integers and integers computed
from integers between -/+ 2^32 - 1 should be valued. 

This is sample project that is more about designing a simple interface with react and typescript with
user interaction over an engineered product that considers for large, small, precise and accurate calculations. 

### Future Development

A full engine might be added. Such an engine would let users type in their expressions.

### Getting Started with Development

The build system is still from the Create React App Template. 

```yarn start```: Starts the dev process.
```yarn build```: Builds an optimized version.
```yarn test```: Runs the tests

Calculator build system spits out files meant to be under /calculator and not on the root.
